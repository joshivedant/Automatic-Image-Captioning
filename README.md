# Automatic-Image-Captioning
- Used Flickr 8k dataset for training and builded a working model of Image caption generator by using CNN with LSTM
- Applied Transfer learning using InceptionV3 model on image dataset by removing its classification layer
- Used glove dataset for word embedding on captions to convert each word into its feature vector representation
- Implemented Merging architecture which takes series of words and feature vector as input and predicts the next word
